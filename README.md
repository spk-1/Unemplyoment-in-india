## Unemplyoment in India      
### Project Overview:
* This project delves into the analysis of unemployment trends across various regions in India, exploring the distribution, variability, and patterns in unemployment rates. The analysis is based on datasets containing information on estimated unemployment, employment figures, and labor participation rates across multiple Indian states.  
### Data Sources:  
* The primary datasets used for this analysis include Unemployment_in_India.csv and Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv. These datasets cover various regions and time periods and were pre-processed to ensure data quality and consistency.
### Key Steps in the Analysis:
1.	Data Preprocessing:  
* Handled missing values and standardized column names.  
*	Removed inconsistencies to improve data reliability.
2.	Data Exploration:  
*	Conducted descriptive statistics and explored data distribution.  
*	Examined the variations in unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labor participation rates.
3. Data Visualization:  
*	Count Plots: Highlighted the distribution of data across regions to understand data representation.  
*	Bar Plots: Illustrated average unemployment and labor participation rates by region.  
*	Box Plots: Displayed the distribution and variability of unemployment and employment rates across different states.  
*	Scatter Plots & Pair Plots: Analyzed relationships between unemployment rate, employment figures, and labor participation rates.  
*	Histograms & KDE Plots: Showed the distribution of key variables, revealing patterns in unemployment and employment.  
4.	Regional Analysis:  
*	Identified states with the highest and lowest average unemployment rates, such as Tripura and Meghalaya, respectively.  
*	Analyzed regional disparities in labor participation and employment, highlighting areas with economic stability and instability.
5.	Time Series Analysis:  
*	Investigated temporal trends in unemployment rates, particularly during the COVID-19 period, which caused significant disruptions in many regions.  
**Tools & Technologies**:      
•	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
•	Plotly for interactive visualizations  
•	Data preprocessing and visualization techniques  
•	Tableau  
## Insights & Conclusions:  
•	Regions such as Tripura and Haryana faced the highest average unemployment rates, indicating severe economic challenges.  
•	Meghalaya and Assam exhibited lower average unemployment rates, suggesting better employment conditions.  
•	The North region consistently showed higher employment levels, while the Northeast displayed high labor participation rates, reflecting diverse economic conditions across states.
Future Work:  
•	Expanding the analysis to include more recent data post-2020 to assess the recovery trends.  
•	Integrating more economic indicators, such as GDP growth and sector-wise employment, to provide a comprehensive view of regional economic health.
